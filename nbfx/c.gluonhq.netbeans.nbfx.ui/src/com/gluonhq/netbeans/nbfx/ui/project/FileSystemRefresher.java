/**
 * Brings the open projects back in sync with what is on disk.
 * <p>
 * The platform's filesystem layer only notices changes made through its own API; changes made
 * behind its back - in a terminal, in the Finder, by a build tool - are picked up when the
 * filesystem is refreshed. The IDE therefore refreshes its project roots whenever its window is
 * activated, which is when the user is most likely to have just done something elsewhere: the
 * navigator then shows what is really there, and a project whose root folder is gone is noticed by
 * {@link ProjectRootWatcher}.
 * <p>
 * The IDE does this in {@code org.netbeans.core.ui.warmup.MenuWarmUpTask}, which listens on the
 * Swing main window - a window a JavaFX application never creates, so the trigger has to be our
 * own. The rest follows the IDE: the refresh is delayed, so that passing through the window on the
 * way somewhere else costs nothing, and it can be turned off by the same two settings the IDE
 * honours, {@code -Dnetbeans.indexing.noFileRefresh=true} and the {@code FileSystemRefreshAction}
 * {@code manual} preference.
 * <p>
 * Only the open project roots are refreshed (recursively), never the whole filesystem, and the work
 * happens on a background thread: a refresh walks the projects on disk and must never block the FX
 * thread. Requests that arrive while one is running are collapsed into a single follow-up run.
