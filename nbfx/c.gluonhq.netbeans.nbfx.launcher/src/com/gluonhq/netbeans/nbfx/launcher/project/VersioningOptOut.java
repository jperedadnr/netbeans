/**
 * Keeps the platform's version control systems out of the way, as NetBeansFX offers no VCS feature.
 * <p>
 * The application depends on whole platform clusters, so the git, mercurial and subversion modules
 * are all present and start working the moment a project is opened - scanning for repositories,
 * building a status cache, resolving ignored files - for an IDE that shows none of it. Beyond the
 * wasted work, that scanning asks who owns each file, which loads projects nobody opened: when a
 * project folder disappears, git resolves the deleted paths against the enclosing Maven aggregator,
 * whose constructor refreshes the filesystem and re-enters the project system
 * ({@code IllegalStateException: Attempt to call ProjectManager.findProject within the body of
 * ProjectFactory.loadProject}).
 * <p>
 * Every versioning system is required to leave a folder alone when
 * {@code VersioningSupport.isExcluded} says so, and that is driven by the
 * {@code versioning.unversionedFolders} system property, so naming the filesystem roots excludes
 * everything. To be removed when NetBeansFX gains VCS support.
