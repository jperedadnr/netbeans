/**
 * Watches the root folder of every open project so a project that stops existing on disk does not
 * stay open with a tree, tabs and actions pointing at nothing.
 * <p>
 * A project is reported as gone when its root folder is deleted <em>or renamed</em>: a project is
 * identified by the absolute path of its root, so a renamed folder is no longer that project - its
 * persisted state, its recent-projects entry and the paths its documents resolve against would all
 * refer to a folder that is no longer there.
 * <p>
 * The listeners are attached to the root {@link FileObject} itself, which also reports what happens
 * to its children, so only events about the root are acted upon. Filesystem events can arrive on
 * any thread: the callback is invoked on the thread that delivered the event and it is up to the
 * caller to hop to the FX thread.
